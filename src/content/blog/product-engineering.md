As a full-stack engineer and founder, I've learned that **the best teams aren't structured around technology — they're structured around customer outcomes.**

## The Problem with Typical Engineering Teams

Most companies organize by layer: frontend team, backend team, infra team. This creates handoff bottlenecks and diffuses ownership. Nobody owns the customer experience end-to-end.

## What Changed for Me

After shipping three products, I realised the fastest teams share one trait: every engineer understands *why* they're building, not just *what*.

## Principles That Work

### 1. Ownership Over Committees
Each engineer owns a feature end-to-end. No waiting for another team to unblock you. You build it, you ship it, you monitor it.

### 2. Product Metrics Drive Decisions
We don't ship based on tech beauty; we ship based on customer value. Every sprint starts with "what user problem are we solving?"

### 3. Speed is a Feature
Velocity compounds. Shipping fast means learning fast. The team that ships 10 experiments in a month learns more than the team that ships 1 perfect feature.

## The Result

Teams structured this way consistently deliver faster, with higher quality, and — most importantly — with features users actually want.
