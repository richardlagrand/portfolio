## Overview

Brightpath is a mobile app I built to help users track their mental health through daily check-ins and journaling.

## Challenge

Users struggled to monitor patterns in their mood and triggers over time.

## Solution

I created a clean, distraction-free interface for daily check-ins with mood tracking, journaling prompts, and trend visualisation.

## Results

- 50+ beta users
- 4.2/5 rating on TestFlight
- Ready for App Store launch

## Tech Deep Dive

### Frontend

- **React Native** for cross-platform iOS/Android
- **Redux** for state management
- Custom gesture animations for smooth UX

### Backend

- **Firebase** for real-time sync
- **Firestore** for flexible schema
- Cloud Functions for notifications

## What I Learned

1. User research saves time (iterate based on feedback)
2. Performance matters on mobile (optimize bundle size)
3. Accessibility improves for everyone
