## Overview

A comprehensive design system inspired by Dutch design principles — clean, functional, and accessible.

## Challenge

Teams across multiple projects were inconsistently implementing UI components, leading to fragmented user experiences.

## Solution

Created a shared component library with Storybook documentation, design tokens, and Figma integration to ensure visual consistency.

## Results

- 30+ reusable components
- Adopted across 3 internal projects
- 40% reduction in UI development time

## Tech Deep Dive

- **React** component library with TypeScript
- **Storybook** for interactive documentation
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling with design tokens
- **Figma** plugin for design-to-code sync
