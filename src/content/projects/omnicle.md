## Overview
Omnicle unifies e-commerce data from multiple sales channels into a single, real-time analytics dashboard.

## Challenge
Small e-commerce businesses selling on multiple platforms had no unified view of their performance data.

## Solution
Built a dashboard that aggregates data from Shopify, Amazon, and WooCommerce into real-time visualisations with D3.js charts.

## Results
- Real-time sync across 3 major platforms
- Average page load under 800ms
- Used by 15+ small businesses in pilot

## Tech Deep Dive
- **Vue.js** for reactive dashboard UI
- **D3.js** for custom data visualisations
- **Node.js** API layer with webhook ingestion
- **MongoDB** for flexible multi-source data storage
