    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Journey</h2>
    <p>
      I started as a designer, transitioned to full-stack engineering, and
      realized my true passion is building products that solve real problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      After working at multiple companies and founding startups, I've learned
      that <strong
        >great products aren't built by engineers alone—they're built by teams
        that understand both the user and the craft</strong
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>I build full-stack products with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>TypeScript/Node.js backends</strong> &rarr; Clean, scalable APIs
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>React/React Native frontends</strong> &rarr; Fast, accessible
        interfaces
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Product thinking</strong> &rarr; Understanding why we're
        building, not just what
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Values</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Clarity over cleverness</strong> &rarr; Code and design should
        be obvious
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Speed matters</strong> &rarr; Performance is a feature; slow
        products lose users
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>User research</strong> &rarr; Build what people want, not what
        we think they want
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ship > Perfect</strong> &rarr; Done is better than perfect;
        iterate based on feedback
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Currently</h2>
    <p>
      Exploring how technology can improve [your current interest area]. Always
      open to discussing product, engineering challenges, or founding
      opportunities.
